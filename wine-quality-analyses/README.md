# Wine Quality Analysis – ML & Statistics

This project analyses the relationship between wine chemical properties and quality using exploratory data analysis, statistical modelling, and machine learning.

The workflow includes correlation analysis, PCA, and outlier detection via Isolation Forest, followed by both regression and classification tasks. Interpretable models (Linear and Elastic Net) are compared with non-linear approaches such as Random Forests, using cross-validation for model selection.

A strong focus is placed on model interpretability, combining statistical significance, feature effects, and local partial derivatives to understand both global and context-dependent relationships. Results show that moderately complex non-linear models achieve the best balance between performance and robustness while preserving interpretability.
